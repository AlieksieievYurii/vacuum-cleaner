This document describes the done experiments in order to create custom vacuum motor.

## First experimental model
The first model of vacuum motor consist of 6 elements. Almost all the parts are printed on 3D printer. A brushed motor is used: DC 12V(1.10 A) 12000RPM 0,425 kg*cm.

Advantages:
* Simple constuction
* Not bad pulling power

Disadvantages:
* Big size -> height: 130 mm, weight: 103 mm, lenght: 107 mm
* High current -> 12v ~ 3.9 A
* No sensor of speed
--------------

Next improvements:
* Decrease heigh and weight sizes
* Decrease diameter of turbine wheel from 80 mm to 55 mm
* Decrease offset between the wall and the turbine wheel -> from 10 mm to 5mm
* Move output pipe to the corner
* Decrease inner diameter of the turbine wheel -> from 29 mm to 25

## Second Model
The height has been shrinked to 75 mm. The wall thickness has been increased to 2mm. The loading on the motor has been descreased from 3.9 to ~ 2.4 A for 12v. Basically, the vacuum strong is not bad.
